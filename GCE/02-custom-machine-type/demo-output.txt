=== Custom Machine Type Demo Journey ===
Date: 2025-07-16
Region: Jakarta (asia-southeast2)

[2025-07-16 - Setup Phase]
- Created project structure with Terraform best practices
- Configured three custom machine types:
  * Micro: 1 vCPU, 1GB RAM (cheapest)
  * Small: 1 vCPU, 2GB RAM (budget)
  * Standard: 2 vCPUs, 2GB RAM (balanced)
- Implemented resource tagging for all resources
- Set up preemptible/spot instances for cost optimization

[2025-07-16 - Deployment Phase]
- Terraform initialized successfully
- Starting deployment with 'micro' instance configuration...
- ✅ Successfully created micro instance (custom-1-1024)
- External IP: 34.101.107.86
- Internal IP: 10.0.1.2

[Testing Phase - Micro Instance]
- Ping test results:
  * 4 packets transmitted, 4 received, 0% packet loss
  * Average RTT: 67.594ms
- HTTP test: ✅ Successfully accessed web page
- Instance confirmed running with custom machine type specifications
- Destroying micro instance to test small configuration...

[2025-07-16 - Small Instance Deployment]
- ✅ Micro instance destroyed successfully
- Updating configuration to 'small' machine type...
- ✅ Successfully created small instance (custom-1-2048)
- External IP: 34.101.107.86
- Internal IP: 10.0.1.2

[Testing Phase - Small Instance]
- Ping test results:
  * 4 packets transmitted, 4 received, 0% packet loss
  * Average RTT: 77.505ms
- HTTP test: ✅ Successfully accessed web page
- Confirmed machine type: custom-1-2048 (1 vCPU, 2GB RAM)
- Destroying small instance to test standard configuration...

[2025-07-16 - Standard Instance Deployment]
- ✅ Small instance destroyed successfully
- Updating configuration to 'standard' machine type...
- ✅ Successfully created standard instance (custom-2-2048)
- External IP: 34.101.86.26
- Internal IP: 10.0.1.2

[Testing Phase - Standard Instance]
- Ping test results:
  * 4 packets transmitted, 4 received, 0% packet loss
  * Average RTT: 46.166ms (fastest of all three instances!)
- HTTP test: ✅ Successfully accessed web page
- Confirmed machine type: custom-2-2048 (2 vCPUs, 2GB RAM)

[2025-07-16 - Summary and Cleanup]
=== POC SUCCESS ===
✅ Successfully tested all three custom machine types:
  1. Micro (custom-1-1024): 1 vCPU, 1GB RAM - Cheapest option
  2. Small (custom-1-2048): 1 vCPU, 2GB RAM - Budget option  
  3. Standard (custom-2-2048): 2 vCPUs, 2GB RAM - Balanced option

All instances:
- Were deployed in Jakarta region (asia-southeast2)
- Used preemptible/spot instances for cost savings
- Had proper tagging and labeling
- Were accessible via ping and HTTP
- Displayed custom web pages with their specifications

Cost optimizations applied:
- Preemptible/spot instances
- Minimal boot disk size (10GB)
- Standard persistent disk type
- Custom machine types for exact resource allocation

Now destroying all resources to avoid costs...
✅ All resources destroyed successfully!

[2025-07-16 - Final Status]
POC COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY
- All three custom machine types tested
- All resources cleaned up
- No ongoing charges
- Demo fully documented in README.md
