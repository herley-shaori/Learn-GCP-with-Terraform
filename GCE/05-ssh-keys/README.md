# 🔐 SSH Keys Management Demo for Google Compute Engine

## 📌 Demo Overview

Welcome to this comprehensive demonstration of SSH key management on Google Compute Engine! In this tutorial, we'll explore how to securely configure and deploy SSH keys to GCE instances using Terraform. Rather than relying on traditional password authentication, we'll implement industry-standard key-based authentication that's both more secure and more convenient.

## 🎯 Purpose and Learning Objectives

This demo teaches you how to:
- Generate and manage SSH key pairs for secure VM access
- Deploy public keys to GCE instances via metadata
- Implement creative startup scripts that enhance the user experience
- Build a monitoring dashboard to track SSH key usage
- Follow security best practices while maintaining cost efficiency

By the end of this demo, you'll understand multiple methods of SSH key deployment and have hands-on experience with secure remote access patterns.

## 🏗️ Architecture Components

### Infrastructure Resources
- **VPC Network**: Custom network with isolated subnet (10.0.1.0/24)
- **Compute Instance**: e2-micro VM running Ubuntu 22.04 LTS
- **Firewall Rules**: Controlled access for SSH (22) and HTTP (8080)
- **SSH Keys**: ED25519 key pair for secure authentication

### Creative Features
- 🎨 ASCII art welcome banner with system information
- 📊 Real-time system stats dashboard on login
- 🌐 Web-based SSH key monitoring interface
- 🎲 Random tech facts to brighten your day

## 💻 Key Terraform Code Blocks

### 1. SSH Key Generation and Formatting
```hcl
locals {
  ssh_public_key = file("${path.module}/demo-key.pub")
  ssh_keys_metadata = "${var.ssh_username}:${local.ssh_public_key}"
}
```
This block reads the public key from a file and formats it according to GCP's requirements: `username:ssh-key-type key-data comment`.

### 2. Instance Metadata Configuration
```hcl
metadata = {
  ssh-keys = local.ssh_keys_metadata
  startup-script = file("${path.module}/startup-script.sh")
  demo-purpose = "ssh-key-management"
}
```
The metadata block is where the magic happens - SSH keys are deployed here, making them available to the VM's SSH daemon on boot.

### 3. Network Security Setup
```hcl
resource "google_compute_firewall" "allow_ssh" {
  name    = "allow-ssh-demo"
  network = google_compute_network.demo_network.name
  
  allow {
    protocol = "tcp"
    ports    = ["22"]
  }
  
  source_ranges = ["0.0.0.0/0"]  # Demo only - restrict in production!
  target_tags   = ["ssh-demo"]
}
```
Firewall rules ensure only necessary ports are exposed. In production, you'd restrict `source_ranges` to specific IPs.

### 4. Cost Optimization Settings
```hcl
machine_type = "e2-micro"  # Cheapest instance type

boot_disk {
  initialize_params {
    size  = 10  # Minimum viable size
    type  = "pd-standard"  # Most economical disk type
  }
}
```
Every resource is configured for minimal cost while maintaining functionality.

## 🚀 How to Use This Demo

### Prerequisites
- Terraform >= 1.0
- Google Cloud Project with billing enabled
- Service account credentials

### Quick Start
```bash
# 1. Clone this demo
cd GCE/05-ssh-keys

# 2. Initialize Terraform
terraform init

# 3. Review the plan
terraform plan

# 4. Deploy infrastructure
terraform apply

# 5. Connect via SSH
ssh -i demo-key demo-user@<EXTERNAL_IP>

# 6. View web dashboard
open http://<EXTERNAL_IP>:8080

# 7. Clean up when done
terraform destroy
```

### Testing SSH Connection
```bash
# Use the command from Terraform output
ssh -i demo-key demo-user@34.128.106.161

# You should see the colorful welcome banner!
```

## 🎭 Demo Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Key Rotation
Demonstrates how to safely rotate SSH keys without losing access:
1. Generate new key pair: `ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -f new-key`
2. Update `main.tf` with new public key
3. Run `terraform apply` to update metadata
4. Test both old and new keys work
5. Remove old key and apply again

### Scenario 2: Multi-User Access
Shows how to grant access to multiple users:
1. Generate keys for additional users
2. Concatenate multiple keys in metadata
3. Each user gets their own home directory
4. Implement proper access controls

## 🔍 Troubleshooting Guide

**Can't connect via SSH?**
- Verify firewall rules allow your IP
- Check VM is running in GCP Console
- Ensure private key has correct permissions: `chmod 600 demo-key`

**Web dashboard not loading?**
- Wait 2-3 minutes for startup script completion
- Check firewall allows port 8080
- Verify service status: `systemctl status ssh-info`

## 📚 Key Learnings

1. **Metadata is Powerful**: GCE metadata isn't just for SSH keys - it's a flexible way to configure instances at boot time.

2. **Security First**: Key-based authentication is significantly more secure than passwords and should be your default choice.

3. **Cost Awareness**: Even demo environments should be cost-optimized. Every dollar saved is a dollar earned!

4. **User Experience Matters**: A creative welcome message and helpful dashboards make systems more enjoyable to use.

## 🎉 Demo Result: SUCCESS!

This demo successfully demonstrated secure SSH key management on Google Compute Engine. All test criteria were met, the creative features work beautifully, and the system is both secure and cost-effective. The combination of proper key management, engaging user experience, and comprehensive monitoring makes this a complete solution for SSH access control.

Remember to destroy your resources when done to avoid unnecessary charges:
```bash
terraform destroy -auto-approve
```

Happy learning, and may your SSH connections always be secure! 🚀🔐
