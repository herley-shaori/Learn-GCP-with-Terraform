=== Startup Script Automation Demo Journey ===
Date: 2025-07-17
Region: Jakarta (asia-southeast2)

[Success Criteria Defined]
âœ… VM must be created successfully
âœ… Startup script must execute automatically on boot
âœ… System monitoring dashboard must be accessible via HTTP
âœ… Dashboard must show real-time system stats
âœ… Health check endpoint must respond
âœ… All services must start automatically

[2025-07-17 - Setup Phase]
- Created project structure with Terraform best practices
- Designed creative startup script: System Health Monitoring Dashboard
- Script features:
  * Flask-based web application
  * Real-time CPU, memory, disk monitoring
  * Beautiful UI with auto-refresh
  * Health check endpoint
  * Systemd service integration
- Implemented comprehensive resource tagging
- Using e2-micro instance for cost optimization

[2025-07-17 - Deployment Phase]
- Initializing Terraform...
- âœ… Terraform initialized successfully
- Plan shows 9 resources to create
- Applying configuration...
- âœ… Successfully created instance: startup-script-demo-ai13
- External IP: 34.128.113.239
- Internal IP: (checking...)
- Dashboard URL: http://34.128.113.239
- Waiting 2 minutes for startup script to complete...

[2025-07-17 - Testing Phase]
Testing all success criteria:

1. âœ… VM created successfully - Instance: startup-script-demo-ai13
2. âœ… Startup script executed automatically - Completed at Thu Jul 17 01:42:10 UTC 2025
3. âœ… System monitoring dashboard accessible:
   - Health endpoint: http://34.128.113.239/health - Status: healthy
   - Dashboard UI: http://34.128.113.239 - Accessible
   - API endpoint: http://34.128.113.239:8080/api/stats - Returning real-time data
4. âœ… Dashboard shows real-time stats:
   - CPU usage: 0.5%
   - Memory usage: 37.5%
   - System uptime: 0:08:21
   - Instance name: startup-script-demo-ai13
   - Zone: asia-southeast2-a
5. âœ… Health check endpoint responds - {"status": "healthy", "timestamp": "2025-07-17T01:47:09.880867"}
6. âœ… All services started automatically - system-dashboard.service is active (running)

Additional tests:
- SSH access: âœ… Working
- Service status: âœ… system-dashboard.service active and running
- Nginx proxy: âœ… Successfully proxying Flask app from port 8080 to 80
- Startup marker: âœ… /var/startup-script-completed exists

[2025-07-17 - POC Result]
ðŸŽ‰ POC SUCCESS! ðŸŽ‰
All success criteria met. The creative startup script successfully:
- Installed all required packages (nginx, python3, flask, psutil)
- Created a Flask-based system monitoring dashboard
- Set up systemd service for automatic startup
- Configured nginx as reverse proxy
- Created beautiful, real-time monitoring UI
- Implemented health check and API endpoints

The dashboard is fully functional and accessible at:
- http://34.128.113.239 (Main dashboard)
- http://34.128.113.239:8080 (Direct Flask access)
- http://34.128.113.239/health (Health check)
- http://34.128.113.239:8080/api/stats (Raw API data)

[2025-07-17 - Cleanup Phase]
- Destroying all resources...
- âœ… All resources destroyed successfully
- No ongoing charges
